# Experiment 5: Sets and Dictionaries in Python

---

## Title

Implementation of Sets and Dictionaries Using Python

---

## Aim

To study the set and dictionary data structures in Python and perform operations such as creation, updating, deletion, and use of built-in methods through program implementation.

---

## Objectives

- To understand the concept and features of sets in Python  
- To perform basic operations on sets  
- To understand dictionaries and key–value pair mapping  
- To create, access, and modify dictionary elements  
- To apply commonly used built-in methods for sets and dictionaries  
- To use sets and dictionaries for efficient data handling

## Theory

### Sets in Python

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets do not allow duplicate values and are mainly used to store non-repetitive data. Since sets are unordered, elements do not have index positions and cannot be accessed using indexing.

Sets are mutable, which means elements can be added or removed after creation. Sets are commonly created using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor.

Python provides several operations on sets such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, making sets useful for comparison-based tasks.

### Dictionaries in Python

A dictionary is a data structure that stores information in the form of key–value pairs. Each key must be unique, while values can be of any data type. Dictionaries are created using curly braces, where keys and values are separated by colons.

Dictionaries are mutable and allow dynamic insertion, modification, and deletion of elements. Values in a dictionary can be accessed directly using their corresponding keys, providing fast and efficient data retrieval.

---

### Operations and Methods

Common operations performed on sets include:
- Adding elements
- Removing elements
- Performing set operations such as union and intersection

Common dictionary operations include:
- Accessing values using keys  
- Adding new key–value pairs  
- Updating existing entries  
- Removing elements using built-in methods  

These operations help in organizing and managing data efficiently.

## Applications

- Removing duplicate values from datasets using sets  
- Storing structured data such as student records using dictionaries  
- Performing comparisons between multiple collections  
- Managing dynamic and searchable data efficiently

## Conclusion

Thus, sets and dictionaries in Python were studied and implemented successfully. This experiment helped in understanding unique data storage using sets and structured data representation using dictionaries along with their practical applications in programming.
